# kudos-system
A fun laravel project for a kudo system

## Goal
To make a kudo system for collegues to motivate good behavior.
Management can assign a couple of goals (kudo points) to reach for a certain "compliment" for the entire force.

## Technical side

### Slack
A slack bot that is connected to the application so you can #thank collegues for their input.
Also when a collegue is thanked it will show in their own feed as a motivator!

In the default General channel a message is dispatched when a goal is reached and what the compliment is.

### Frontend
A simple frontend is created to keep track of the goals. Collegue thanks are shown in the user profiles of Slack.
